# Nashville Promise Zone Locator

[Try me!](https://aton.al/npz-locator)

This web app reports whether or not addresses are in the Nashville Promise Zone. It uses the [US Census Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder) to find the census tract of an address and compares the census tract result with a list of subzones in the Nashville Promise Zone.

The app can take either a single address or a bulk upload.
